               <p>
                  I am an enthusiastic and results-driven software engineer with over three years
                  of professional experience at SOTI India Pvt Ltd, a leading provider of mobile
                  and IoT device management solutions. Throughout my career, I have
                  consistently demonstrated my ability to contribute to all stages of
                  the software development lifecycle, from designing and coding to 
                  testing and deploying applications. My primary focus has been full
                  stack development, cloud engineering, and DevOps, areas in which
                  I have successfully executed several key projects that enhanced 
                  the company’s technology stack and improved operational efficiency.

               <summary>My Role in SOTI</summary>
               <p>
                  At SOTI, I have worked extensively on the .NET technology stack, developing scalable,
                  robust, and secure web applications. One of my key responsibilities has been API 
                  development, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design, build, and
                  maintain RESTful APIs that seamlessly integrated with various front-end and back-end 
                  systems. In addition to my expertise in backend development, I also have hands-on 
                  experience in front-end technologies, including JavaScript frameworks such as Angular
                  and React, allowing me to deliver full stack solutions that meet both the functional
                  and aesthetic requirements of the end users.
                  <br><br>
                  My role at SOTI has also involved a strong focus on cloud engineering. 
                  I have worked on deploying applications and services on cloud platforms, 
                  leveraging tools like Microsoft Azure to ensure high availability, scalability,
                  and performance. In the rapidly evolving field of cloud computing, I have
                  constantly sought to stay up to date with new technologies and best practices,
                  which has enabled me to implement cost-effective and reliable solutions.
                  As a DevOps practitioner, I have been responsible for setting up continuous
                  integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, automating build and
                  deployment processes, and maintaining infrastructure as code (IaC) using 
                  tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

               <summary>My Interests and Education</summary>
               <p>
                  In addition to my technical expertise, I am a proactive problem-solver who
                  enjoys tackling complex challenges and finding creative solutions. My 
                  collaborative approach to working with cross-functional teams, including product
                  managers, designers, and QA engineers, has allowed me to deliver high-quality
                  software that meets business requirements and exceeds customer expectations. 
                  My strong communication skills and ability to translate technical concepts 
                  into understandable terms have made me an effective team player and leader 
                  in various project settings.
                  <br><br>
                  Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at
                  Northeastern University, Boston, with a focus on deepening my technical
                  expertise and exploring new domains such as artificial intelligence, 
                  machine learning, and advanced cloud architectures. I believe this academic
                  endeavor will equip me with the skills and knowledge needed to tackle 
                  some of the most pressing challenges in the software industry, and to 
                  contribute to innovative solutions that drive technological advancement.
                  <br><br>
                  Looking ahead, I am excited to leverage my experience and education to contribute
                  to impactful projects in software engineering, cloud technologies, and AI.
                  My long-term goal is to continue growing as a software engineer while staying
                  at the forefront of emerging technologies, enabling businesses to optimize their
                  operations and create value through cutting-edge software solutions.
