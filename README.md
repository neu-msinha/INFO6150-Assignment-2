# Professional Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a professional portfolio website showcasing my experience, projects, and skills as a Software Engineer. The website is responsive and incorporates modern web development best practices using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It adheres to the guidelines for using specific HTML and HTML5 controls, and all styling is done through an external CSS file.

## Features
The website includes the following sections:
- **Home Page**: Introduction and links to key sections.
- **About Page**: Information about my professional background.
- **Projects Page**: Overview of the projects I have worked on, with images and descriptions.
- **Contact Page**: A form to get in touch with me.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling the website, including custom selectors for tables and image hover effects.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons are used across the navigation and contact sections. To ensure offline functionality, the Font Awesome CDN was downloaded and included locally. You can download Font Awesome for your project from [here](https://fontawesome.com/v5/download).
- **JavaScript**: Used very briefly for enhancing website interactivity, such as for the dropdown menu.

## Key HTML5 Elements
The following HTML5 elements are used throughout the website:
- **Favicon**: The icon shown in the browser tab.
- **Table**: Used in the "Projects" section to present data in a structured manner.
- **Form**: A contact form is included for visitors to reach out to me.
- **Images**: Displaying project screenshots and personal photos.
- **Hyperlink**: Navigation and social media links are embedded throughout the site.
- **Button**: Used for form submissions and navigation.
- **Audio/Video**: Background audio and an embedded video are included for dynamic content.
- **Header/Footer**: These provide consistent navigation and site branding across all pages.
- **Summary**: Used for collapsible content sections.
- **Menu**: Navigation menus and social media links are managed through `<ul>` and `<menu>` tags.
- **tel/mailto**: Included in the "Contact" page for easy communication.

## CSS Features
- **External CSS**: All styling is handled via an external CSS file for maintainability.
- **Float and Overflow**: Used for organizing content and images.
- **Column Layout**: Employed for a clean, professional structure.
- **Absolute/Relative Positioning**: Applied to ensure proper placement of elements like icons and the sidebar.
- **CSS Selectors**: Custom selectors are used to style elements like tables and images.
- **Hover Effects**: Implemented on the image gallery to reveal captions on hover.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used to ensure the website is fully responsive on devices like iPads (768px) and smartphones (350-365px).

## Offline Font Awesome Integration
To make the site functional offline, I downloaded the Font Awesome CDN and included it in the project files. This ensures that all icons are available even without an internet connection.

You can download Font Awesome for your project from [here](https://fontawesome.com/v5/download).

## Responsiveness
The website has been made responsive using media queries. The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, including tablets and smartphones, providing an optimal user experience across devices.
